# ChatIO

This project is a scalable realtime chat application built using SockeIO, Redis, TypeScript, Express, Nextjs, and Prisma. 
It leverages `socket.io` for real-time communication and `prisma` for database interactions and Redis for horizontal scaling.

## Hosted on
https://chatio.ankitsh.cc/

## Built With
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/): Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/): Used Redis as adapter for socket.io to enable horizontal scaling.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): Prisma is a modern database access toolkit that enables developers to easily access databases using type-safe queries.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
- [NeonDB](https://neon.tech/): NeonDB is a cloud-based database service that provides a fully managed, scalable, and secure database solution for modern applications.
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/): Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
